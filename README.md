# Create Confectionery: Retempered
Rewrite of [Create Confectionery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-confectionery), a mod that adds various sugary delights to the game. This mod is an addon for [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create).
Note that this is **just** a rewrite. There is **no artwork** of any kind in this repo. I suggest you download the original mod yourself if you want those assets.

## Features (over original)
- Gingerbread men have had a complete rework to their AI. Here are some key changes:
  - No longer silent - gingerbread men have voices and an impish giggle.
  - Repairable with gingerdough - for when your gingerbuddies get hurt.
  - Mischievous - they love to play all sorts of pranks on unsuspecting players.
  - Attack monsters - gingerbread men defend from evil threats.
- The Bright Side is remixed a little to make it less loud when played from a jukebox.
- Liquid chocolates all have proper fluid interactions with lava.
- Full chocolate bars play the full eat animation when used, rather than instantly disappearing.
