Rewrite of [Create Confectionery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-confectionery), a mod that adds various sugary delights to the game. This mod is an addon for [Create](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create).

## Features (over original)
- Liquid chocolates all have proper fluid interactions with lava.
- Full chocolate bars play the full eat animation when used, rather than instantly disappearing as a hack.
- Gingerbread men have advanced AI. They are mischievous, and tend to play all sorts of pranks on unsuspecting players.
